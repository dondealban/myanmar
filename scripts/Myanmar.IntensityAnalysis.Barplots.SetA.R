# This R script generates barlots using ggplot2 package to visualise the results of
# intensity analysis of changes between 9 land cover types derived from combined
# Landsat and L-band SAR data covering Tanintharyi, Myanmar. This script plots SetA
# values consisting of 1995 and 2015 data from Landsat-5 (7 bands, 5 indices) and
# JERS-1 or ALOS/PALSAR-2 (1 polarisation and 8 GLCM textures).
#
# Land cover types include: forest (FOR); mangrove (MNG); oil palm mature (OPM);
# rubber mature (RBM); shrub/orchard (SHB); rice paddy (RPD); built-up area (BUA);
# bare soil/ground (BSG); and water (WTR).
