# This R script generates barlots using ggplot2 package to visualise the results of
# intensity analysis of changes between 4 land cover types derived from ESA CCI land
# cover data (1992-2015) covering Tanintharyi, Myanmar. The original land cover classes
# were reclassified into four bespoke classes: Forest (FOR), Other Vegetation (VEG),
# Cropland (CRP), and Non-Forest (NON).
#
# Intensity analysis was calculated using Dinamica EGO platform using the 24 annual 
# ESA CCI land cover data layers. The domain of the analysis is the landscape extent
# within the following coordinates: 97 to 100 deg E longitude; 9 to 16 deg N latitude.
