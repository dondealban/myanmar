## README_TEST

**Creator:** J Johanness

**Date:** 18-09-2018

**Purpose:**

This will be a .md file detailing the procedures I have managed to complete in learning GitHub/RStudio/Atom

1. Managed to create a new folder within the repo within Atom
 - 1. Copy full path of folder (Ctrl+Shift+C)

 - 2. Right-click folder & paste the path

 - 3. Add at the end of the path 'README_TEST.md'

   -  Which creates the Markdown file in this folder

2. After ***Staging*** and then typing my GitHub useer ID and pw, the Commit was then ***Pushed*** to GitHub

 - The new folder and the .md file can now be seen on the repo that I am a Collaborator on.

 - **However**, I cannot see these lines of text yet.

 *Note:* There appears to be a bug where if any text in the repo path has a spacing in it, the unstaged changes may not show up in Atom window "Unstaged Changes".

 Link to this thread can be found [here](https://discuss.atom.io/t/git-unstaged-changes-not-showing-up/48337/13)

3. So, it is not that it does **NOT** show up, but rather within Atom, you have to go to File > Save, and then under your project window, all the files/folders where there were changes made, will be *Orange* in colour

 - Now it does appear on the Unstaged Changes window.

 - Attempting Staging and Pushing to the GitHub repo.

4. This final comment is done not in Atom, but in GitHub, signifying
 - (1) the Push from Atom worked correctly
 - (2) I can now see the code in the .md file
 - (3) I am making these final comments to test if they show up on Atom after I push it from within GitHub
 
 
**End**
