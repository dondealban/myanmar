# Purpose: This is to experiment with creating and commiting an R script to test if
# its changes will be documented by GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and Atom
# and which of these can we manipulate the R Script directly (not R Markdown, unless they are interchangeably linked in some way)

# Firstly, this Script was done via Ctrl + Shift + N (New R Script), which I believe once I save, I will need to Commit and Push to the repo

# Script Example

# This test/experimentation for R Scripts for GitHub, will be done for the calculation of the proportions for each change from the QGIS SCP LCCR .csv's to generate a stacked area chart to see which transitions contributed the most to overall change in the landscape

Note that if you try to open a .zip folder in R (through Git), it will open up WinRAR, unlike in Atom, where it opens up immediately
So, of course, you can edit the code in Atom, but unlike in RStudio, you cannot "Run" the script
