Purpose: 
The contents of this folder specifically deal with the procedures conducted prior to the land cover change analysis performed by QGIS 2.18.15 Semi-Automatic Classification (SCP) Plugin.

These include;

(1) The preparation of the ESRI Shapefiles sourced by the Database of Global Administrative Areas (https://gadm.org/)
(2) The QGIS 2.18.15 Processing Modeler which was used to subset the country-wide raster map to each of the 15 division/states 

For confidentiality purposes, the rasters (masked) are not shared in this public repository.
