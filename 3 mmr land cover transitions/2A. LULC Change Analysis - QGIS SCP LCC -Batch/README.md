**Purpose:**

The contents of this folder specifically refer to the conduct of LULC change analysis via QGIS 2.18.15 [Semi-Automatic Classification (SCP) Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SemiAutomaticClassificationPlugin/) to generate the cross-tabulation matrices fed into the Intensity Analysis ([Aldwaik & Pontius, 2013](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2013.787618))


This folder holds the following;

1. Change Maps per Domain per interval

2. The .csv outputs from QGIS SCP LCC function. 


**Note:**

These results are to be compared against the outputs from Dinamica EGO in conducting the LULC change analysis.

Decision on which to use will be based upon the comparison between the following;

1. Trends at each level of the Intensity Analysis 

2. Values of Uniform Intensities

3. Values for Commission/Omission error
