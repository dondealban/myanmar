### Generation of barplots at Interval- and Category-Level of Intensity Analysis in RStudio

**Creator:** J Johanness

**Date:** 17-09-2018

**Purpose:**

This folder pertains to any and all procedures involved in generating final (or intermediate) outputs in creating the barplots at the interval and category level of the Intensity Analysis

Specifically, it contains the following;

1. The cross-tabulation matrices per domain per time interval that was fed into the IA Macro-XLS

2. The (draft and working) R scripts that were used to generate the barplots

3. The Pre-prepared .csv's (and .xlsx's) that hold the tabular IA data used at the interval and category (Gains & Losses tables)

4. The .csv output from the Rscript after subsetting and re-naming the column labels

5. The IA plots for the Interval & Category level for all domains/intervals

**Note:** 

As of the creation of this folder (17-09-18), these plots were created separately in RStudio as a post-hoc upload into this Github repository. Ideally, this should **NOT** be the case, and in fact, the preparation of these scripts should be done at the start via the synergistic use of RStudio, GitHub Desktop and Atom. 

All previous work regarding this section is contained within the .zip folder [150918 MMR Barplots](myanmar/3 mmr land cover transitions/3. Plotting barplots in RStudio/150918 MMR Barplots.zip).
