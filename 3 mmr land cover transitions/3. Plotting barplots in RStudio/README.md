Purpose:
This folder pertains to any and all procedures involved in generating final (or intermediate) outputs in creating the barplots at the interval and category level of the Intensity Analysis

Specifically, it contains the following;
(1) The cross-tabulation matrices per domain per time interval that was fed into the IA Macro-XLS
(2) The (draft and working) R scripts that were used to generate the barplots
(3) The Pre-prepared .csv's (and .xlsx's) that hold the tabular IA data used at the interval and category (Gains & Losses tables)
(4) The .csv output from the Rscript after subsetting and re-naming the column labels
(5) The IA plots for the Interval & Category level for all domains/intervals

Note: 
While for the national and division/state administrative unit level, this was done outside of GitHub Desktop/Atom, i.e. as a post-hoc upload into this GitHub repository, GitHub Desktop/Atom should be at the start of the procedure
