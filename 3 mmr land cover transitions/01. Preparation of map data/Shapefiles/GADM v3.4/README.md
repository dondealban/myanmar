### Archive of the GADM 3.4 Shapefiles

**Creator:** J Johanness

**Date:** 18-09-2018

**Purpose:**

This folder serves as an archive for the GADM v3.4 Shapefiles, in the event that it is no longer accessible/downloadable from [Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM)](https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html). The Shapefiles within this folder were **accessed/downloaded on 18-09-2018.**

**Note:**

Even though the GADM webpage mentions it as GADM v3.6, the "license.txt" actually documents it as GADM v3.4.

**End**
