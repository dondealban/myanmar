Purpose:
The contents of this folder specifically refer to the conduct of LULC change analysis via Dinamica EGO v4 to conduct the change analysis, and the Intensity Analysis (https://www.csr.ufmg.br/dinamica/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=intensity_analysis)
The reason for experimenting this method is because it automates everything from the LULC change analysis, to the IA results, which would have otherwise have to be iterated manually through the Macro-XLS.

Keep in mind of the following;
(1) Minor numerical differences after the 8th/9th decimal places for values

(2) At the category and transition level, there is no value for the 'Hypothesized error % required in the whole domain'

*This calculation is done within the Macro-XLS but not in the Dinamica IA model


This folder holds the following;

(1) Model inputs

(2) Model outputs


Note:
These results are to be compared against the outputs from Dinamica EGO in conducting the LULC change analysis.

Decision on which to use will be based upon the comparison between the following;

(1) Trends at each level of the Intensity Analysis 
(2) Values of Uniform Intensities
(3) Values for Commission/Omission error
