### Conducting LULC Change Analysis (and Intensity Analysis) using Dinamica EGO

**Creator:** J Johanness

**Date:** 17-09-2018

**Purpose:**

The contents of this folder specifically refer to the conduct of LULC change analysis via [Dinamica Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (EGO) Intensity Analysis model](https://www.csr.ufmg.br/dinamica/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=intensity_analysis) to conduct the change analysis and the Intensity Analysis. 

The reason for experimenting this method is because it automates everything from the LULC change analysis, to the IA results, which would have otherwise have to be iterated manually through the Macro-XLS.

**Differences between the .csv Intensity Analysis outputs from QGIS SCP LCC *vs* Dinamica EGO Intensity Analysis model**

1. Minor numerical differences after the 8th/9th decimal places for values

2. At the category and transition level, there is no calculation for the value 'Hypothesized error % required in the whole domain', which is found within the [Intensity Analysis Macro-XLS](https://sites.google.com/site/intensityanalysis/free-computer-programs).


This folder holds the following;

1. Model inputs

2. Model outputs


**Note:**

These results are to be compared against the outputs from Dinamica EGO in conducting the LULC change analysis. The decision on which to use will be based upon the comparison between the following;

1. Trends at each level of the Intensity Analysis 
2. Values of Uniform Intensities
3. Values for Commission/Omission error

**End**
