# This script generates plots from the results of the independence tests implemented
# in DINAMICA EGO to assess the independence (or association/correlation) of spatial
# determinants (e.g., biophysical and socio-economic variables) that can be used for
# calculating the location probabilities of land use/cover transitions related to
# agriculturalexpansion of major crop commodities (i.e., oil palm, rubber, rice) in
# Tanintharyi Region, Myanmar.
