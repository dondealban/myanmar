# Understanding Land-System Change in Myanmar
This is the main drawing-board repository for the 'Understanding Land-System Change in Myanmar' project. The repository is organised into a series of studies or papers (i.e., planned, ongoing, and completed) that seek to explore and understand the land system change dynamics in Myanmar, a country experiencing profound social-economic-political transitions. Each study/paper is organised and contained in a folder, which contains relevant working files, data, scripts, outputs, and development notes for the specific study topic. Note that this repository contains working versions of files in varying stages of progress. Completed studies are noted and links are provided to a separate repository that contains the final versions.

**Note: This repository is undergoing major restructuring and reogranisation. Watch this space.**

## List of Studies/Papers

#### 1. Land cover change analysis in Tanintharyi, Myanmar
This study explored the synergy of optical and L-band SAR data for mapping and monitoring land/forest cover change in Myanmar over a twenty-year period. Landsat (5/8) and L-band SAR (JERS-1/PALSAR-2) data were combined to generate land cover maps at two time points, specifically 1995 and 2015. Image processing and analysis tasks for this study were carried out using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com), [ESA SNAP Toolbox](https://earthengine.google.com), [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org), and [R Software for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org), among others. Land cover transitions over the 20-year period, such as forest conversion into tree-based agricultural plantations like oil palm and rubber, were analysed.

The study has been completed and published as an open-access paper entitled, *Combined Landsat and L-band SAR data improves land cover classification and change detection in dynamic tropical landscapes,* in [Remote Sensing](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing) journal on February 2018. Also, please head over to the GitHub repository [ms-remote-sens-2018](https://github.com/dondealban/ms-remote-sens-2018) for the final versions of the materials used in the published paper.
