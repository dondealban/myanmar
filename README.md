# Understanding Land-System Change in Myanmar
This is the main drawing-board repository for the 'Understanding Land-System Change in Myanmar' project. The repository is organised into a series of studies or papers (i.e., planned, ongoing, and completed) that seek to explore and understand the land-system change dynamics in Myanmar, a country experiencing profound social-economic-political transitions. Each study/paper is organised and contained in a folder, which contains relevant working files, data, scripts, outputs, development notes, as well as project boards (where available) for the specific study topic. Note that this main repository contains the working versions of files at varying stages of progress. Completed studies are noted and links are provided to a separate repository that contains the final versions.

## List of Studies/Papers

#### 1. Analysing land cover change in Tanintharyi, Myanmar
This study explored the synergy of optical and L-band SAR data for mapping and monitoring land/forest cover change in Tanintharyi Region, Myanmar over a twenty-year period. Landsat (5/8) and L-band SAR (JERS-1/PALSAR-2) data were combined to generate land cover maps at two time points, specifically 1995 and 2015. Image processing and analysis tasks for this study were carried out using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com), [ESA SNAP Toolbox](https://earthengine.google.com), [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org), and [R Software for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org), among others. Land cover transitions over the 20-year period, such as forest conversion into tree-based agricultural plantations like oil palm and rubber, were analysed.

The study has been completed and published as an open-access paper entitled, *Combined Landsat and L-band SAR data improves land cover classification and change detection in dynamic tropical landscapes,* in [Remote Sensing](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing) journal on February 2018. Also, please head over to the GitHub repository [ms-remote-sens-2018](https://github.com/dondealban/ms-remote-sens-2018) for the final versions of the materials used in the published paper.

#### 2. Investigating land-system regime shifts
This study examined the occurrence of land-system regime shifts in a dynamic landscape in southern Myanmar through the application of complementary analytical frameworks. The 24-year annual time-series ESA CCI global land cover product coupled with extensive literature review were used to explore the dynamics of the land-system regime shift. The manuscript has been submitted and is currently under review.

#### 3. Understanding land cover transitions at country and sub-national scales
This study analyses the land cover change transitions and the underlying drivers of these changes in Myanmar over a twenty-year period. Using the approach developed from a previous study (see item 1 above), this country-scale analysis utilises combined Landsat (5/7/8) and L-band SAR (JERS-1/PALSAR-1/PALSAR-2) data, including ancillary data layers, to generate historical land cover maps at three time-points: 1996, 2007, and 2016. The land cover transitions over two time -intervals, 1996-2007 and 2007-2016, are analysed using the [Intensity Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204612000618) framework.

#### 4. Analysing spatial patterns and determinants of land cover change
This study intends to analyse the spatial patterns and spatial determinants that contribute to the explanation of land cover change in Tanintharyi Region, Myanmar.

#### 5. Simulating future land cover change
This study intends to develop spatially explicit models of future land cover change in Myanmar based on various policy and development scenarios in the region. Two land cover datasets are being used for developing the predictive models: the combined Landsat + L-band SAR data (30m, 1995-2015); and the global ESA CCI annual land cover product (300m, 1992-2015).
